    <h1>organism.js (a sandboxels mod)</h1>

    <p>organism.js is a small mod heavily inspired by biology.js (go check it out too!).</p>

    <p>Elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chlorocyte - Generates energy, the more free pixels around it the more it generates. (3 per free pixel)</li>
        <li>Root - Stores water and converts it into energy, can also generate energy from mud, dirt, wet sand, and sand.</li>
        <li>Fermentocyte - Stores sugar and converts it into high amounts of energy, however, it makes waste.</li>
        <li>Lipocyte - Like fat, stores excess energy (up to 18000) for later use.</li>
        <li>Urocyte - Excretes waste.</li>
        <li>Waste - Just waste. Edible to ants.</li>
        <li>Respira - Just like the Chlorocyte, but generates breath instead of energy.</li>
        <li>Aerocyte - Converts energy into breath, but also makes waste in the process.</li>
        <li>Vena - Transfers energy, breath, and waste (only waste transferrer) when powered.</li>
        <li>Neurocell - Generates a single charge every 16 ticks.</li>
        <li>Structura - Doesnt really do anything... Thinking about removing it.</li>
        <li>Slimecoat - Generates mucus around itself as a light protective layer.</li>
        <li>Mucotoxin - Generates toxic mucus around itself for defense, it can eat every animal&insect except humans but it makes waste.</li>
        <li>Mucus - Like disappearing slime</li>
        <li>Toxic Mucus - Like disappearing toxic slime</li>
        <li>Carapace - a heat-resistant, cancer/infection-proof shell</li>
        <li>Phagocyte - Turns cancer, infection, and poison around it in a 3px radius into stem cells.</li>
        <li>thats all</li>
    </ul>

    <p>make sure to connect everything with venas so it doesnt die and keep them powered.</p>
